Install Spotifyd:

bash

sudo apt-get install spotifyd

Install a compatible controller, such as ncspot:

bash

sudo apt-get install ncspot

Configure Spotifyd:
Create a configuration file for Spotifyd. You may use a text editor like nano or vim to create the file. For example:

bash

nano ~/.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf

Add your Spotify application client ID and secret to the configuration file:

makefile

[global]
backend = alsa
volume-control = alsa

[spotify]
username = your_username
password = your_password
client_id = your_client_id
client_secret = your_client_secret

Replace your_username, your_password, your_client_id, and your_client_secret with your Spotify account details.

Run Spotifyd:

bash

spotifyd

Run ncspot in another terminal window:

bash

    ncspot

Again, please note that the availability of software and plugins may have changed since my last update in January 2022. Always check for the latest information and ensure compatibility with your specific Linux distribution and version.
